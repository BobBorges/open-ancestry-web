# Open Ancestry Web

Open Ancestry Web is a fully customizable template for creating a website to collaborate on genealogy research with family members and others. It is an open-source Django-based project.

Don't appreciate the big ancestry websites' business model? Want to be in control of the fruits of your own labor, private sources and family photos?

Get a copy of Open Ancestry Web from <a href="https://github.com/BobBorges/open-ancestry-web">Github</a> and run it on your own webserver.


## Quick Start

1. Clone the <a href="https://github.com/BobBorges/open-ancestry-web">Github Repo</a>.
2. Set up an environment by running `initialize.sh`, then run python dev server or navigate to the site's URL
3. Create yourself a user in the Django Shell and asign it superuser status.
4. Log in to to the admin panel and add at least one person and one source.
5. Navigate to the public facing site and start exploring. Add more people / sources, define relationships, events, epochs, etc.
