	<h1>Nugget Views</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the <em>Nuggetss</em> section!</p>
	<p>Select an Biographical Information Nugget on the sidebar (to the left) to view and edit its details.</p>
	<p>People are at the center of data structure, so for instance &mdash; a person must exist in the database before you can create Events, Epochs and/or Research Items related to that person; two people must already exist in the database before you can define a relationship between them; a source must exist in the database before it can be assigned as an attribute of a Person, Event, Epoch, or Relationship.</p>
	<h2>Add a Biographical Information Nugget</h2>
	<p>When an Nugget is not already defined, you can add it to the data base by clicking 'Add an Nugget' below.</p>
	
	<a href="{% url 'nugget-add' %}"><button>Add a Nugget</button></a>
